## Gesture-Based Mouse Control

This project allows users to control the mouse cursor, perform left-click, right-click, scroll, and drag actions using hand gestures. The system is implemented using MediaPipe for hand tracking and TensorFlow for gesture recognition, making it suitable for a variety of use cases in accessibility and hands-free control.

### Project Overview

The project consists of four main Python files:
1. **data_collection.py**: This script is used to collect hand gesture data, save it into the appropriate directories, and preprocess it for training.
2. **gesturecontrolmodel.h5**: The trained model file that is used for recognizing the gestures.
3. **training_model.py**: This file contains the code to train the gesture recognition model using the data collected in the data collection step.
4. **testing_model.py**: This script is used to test the performance of the trained model on new data.
5. **implementation_of_mouse_gesture.py**: This file implements the mouse control system based on the recognized gestures, enabling actions like cursor movement, left-click, right-click, scroll, and drag.

### Features

- **Cursor Movement**: The mouse cursor moves based on the hand position.
- **Left Click**: Perform a left-click action when the respective gesture is recognized.
- **Right Click**: Perform a right-click action with a single press.
- **Scroll**: Scroll up or down using gestures.
- **Drag**: Click and drag items based on the gesture.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install the required packages with the following command:


### Required Libraries

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow
- Mouse (Python library for controlling the mouse)

## How to Use

1. **Collect Data**: 
   Run the `data_collection.py` file to collect hand gesture data for training. This will create necessary directories and save data in the specified format.
   
2. **Train the Model**:
   After collecting data, run the `training_model.py` file to train the model. This will use the collected data to create a trained gesture recognition model and save it as `gesturecontrolmodel.h5`.

3. **Test the Model**:
   Run `testing_model.py` to test the trained model's performance.

4. **Run the Gesture-Controlled Mouse**:
   Finally, execute the `implementation_of_mouse_gesture.py` to control the mouse using gestures. It will continuously capture video from your webcam, recognize the gestures, and perform the corresponding mouse actions.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues with hand detection, ensure the lighting conditions are optimal, and try to keep your hand within the camera's view.
- Make sure that the model is trained with sufficient data for accurate gesture recognition.
